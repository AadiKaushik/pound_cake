I love making this easy homemade pound cake recipe from scratch because it tastes so good, and it impresses everyone. I’ve been told it’s the best pound cake recipe, and I’m biased, but I wholeheartedly agree.

Because all butter pound cakes have such simple flavor, I always bake them from scratch so I can use the best ingredients. Grab the best butter, the best eggs, and the best vanilla extract you can find for this easy pound cake
